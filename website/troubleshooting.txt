# NOTE for requirements.txt file: Make sure to always keep the Werkzeug and Flask libraries as the older versions (current version right now is 3.0.0). This is because there is some error where Flask requires Werzeug to be the current version, but Werkzeug is not compatible with Flask for whatever reason. Link to Stack Overflow that provides the solution to just have both Flask and Werzeug be the older versions: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77215107/importerror-cannot-import-name-url-decode-from-werkzeug-urls. This one works the best for Heroku and (at last) got the app to be uploaded and hooked up to Heroku.
# Please do not change this, and if for some reason the requirements.txt file is forcefully rewritten, just make sure to add BOTH Flask and Werkzeug as 2.3.0, unless the newer version works now!
